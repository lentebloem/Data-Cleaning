# Final Project

Running `run_analysis.R` script will generates the tidy data file that has mean and standard deviation values of several measurement data of accelerometer and gyroscope in time and frequency. Each result corresponds to a specific activity. Columns: subject ID for each subject, and activityclass. Other columns are the mean and std from the experiment for each subject and activity class.
